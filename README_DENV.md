SG-DENV README
Explanations

This README provides an overview of the data columns and script requirements for the SG-DENV project.
Data Columns

    ID: Sample ID
    Genome: The name of the FASTA file
    Serotype: The serotype of the sample
    Genotype: The genotype of the sample
    Passed_QC: Quality control (use 'A' for approved samples, 'R' for rejected samples; only samples marked 'A' will be used)
    State: The state
    Collection_Date: Collection date
    REQUESTING_UNIT: The name of partner laboratories (if not applicable, put the name of your lab)
    PARTNER_PROJECT: Partner's name (if not applicable, just put the name of your lab)

Script Explanation

    Location Column:
        In the df_final['Location'] column, replace 'continent' and 'country' with the actual continent and country of origin.

        python

    df_final['Location'] = df_passed_qc.apply(lambda row: f"continent / country / {row['state']}", axis=1)

Sequence Naming:

    In the df_troca['Seqs'] column, replace 'country' with the actual country of origin and use the appropriate state abbreviation from the siglas dictionary.

    python

    df_troca['Seqs'] = df_passed_qc.apply(lambda row: f"hDenV{row['Serotype']}/country/{siglas.get(row['state'], '')}-{row['ID']}/{row['Collection_Date'].year}", axis=1)

Virus Naming:

    Similarly, for the df_final['Virus name'] column, replace 'country' with the actual country of origin and use the appropriate state abbreviation from the siglas dictionary.

    python

    df_final['Virus name'] = df_passed_qc.apply(lambda row: f"hDenV{row['Serotype']}/country/{siglas.get(row['state'], '')}-{row['ID']}/{row['Collection_Date'].year}", axis=1)

Sequencing Technology:

    Set the sequencing technology used. By default, it is 'Illumina'. Replace 'Illumina' with your sequencer if different.

    python

        df_final['Sequencing technology'] = 'Illumina'
