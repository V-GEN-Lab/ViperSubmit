SG-COV README
Explanations

This README provides an overview of the data columns and script requirements for the SG-COV project.
Data Columns

    ID: Sample ID
    Type: Sample type
    Genome: The name of the FASTA file
    Passed_QC: Quality control (use 'A' for approved samples; only samples marked 'A' will be used)
    State: The state
    Collection_Date: Collection date
    REQUESTING_UNIT: The name of partner laboratories (if not applicable, put the name of your lab)
    PARTNER_PROJECT: Partner's name (if not applicable, just put the name of your lab)

Script Explanation

    Author Names:
        Define the partner_authors dictionary with the names of the authors.

    partner_authors = {
        # Example:
        # 'LabName': "Author1, LastName; Author2, LastName; ..."
    }

State Abbreviations:

    Define the abbreviations dictionary with the state names and their corresponding abbreviations.


    abbreviations = {
        # Example:
        # 'StateName': 'Abbreviation'
    }

Sequence Naming:

    In the df_exchange['Seqs'] column, replace 'country' with your actual country and use the appropriate state abbreviation from the abbreviations dictionary.

    python

    df_exchange['Seqs'] = df_passed_qc.apply(lambda row: f"hCoV-19/country/{abbreviations.get(row['state'], '')}-IB_{row['ID']}/{row['Collection_Date'].year}", axis=1)

Location Column:

    In the df_final['Location'] column, replace 'continent' and 'country' with the actual continent and country of origin.

    python

    df_final['Location'] = df_passed_qc.apply(lambda row: f"continent / country / {row['state']}", axis=1)

Sequencing Technology:

    Set the sequencing technology used. By default, it is 'Illumina'. Replace 'Illumina' with your sequencer if different.

    python

        df_final['Sequencing technology'] = 'Illumina'
